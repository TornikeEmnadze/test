    <!-- <h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Inception (2010)</li>
        <p>Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief, but not in the typical sense. He specializes in entering people's dreams and stealing their deepest secrets. Cobb's abilities make him a valuable asset, but they also come with a cost. Haunted by the memories of his past, he is offered a chance at redemption - a final job that could give him his life back. However, this job involves not stealing an idea, but planting one. Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller explores the layers of dreams and reality, blurring the lines between perception and the subconscious.</p>
        <li>The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)</li>
        <p>Directed by Wes Anderson, this eccentric and visually stunning film recounts the adventures of Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel, and Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), a lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves a valuable painting, a disputed will, and a murder mystery, all set against the backdrop of a rapidly changing Europe between the wars. With Anderson's signature style, the film is a delightful blend of comedy, drama, and whimsy.</p>
        <li>Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</li>
        <p>A sequel to the 1982 classic, Blade Runner 2049, directed by Denis Villeneuve, is set in a dystopian future where bioengineered humans known as replicants are virtually indistinguishable from real humans. Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a blade runner, uncovers a long-buried secret that could plunge what's left of society into chaos. His journey leads him to Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former blade runner missing for three decades. The film explores themes of identity, humanity, and the consequences of playing with the boundaries between the artificial and the natural.</p>
